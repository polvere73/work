In HTML directory I have some meteo graphs generated starting from a google sheet via an apps script, calling open-meteo.com with API key.
Then onother script writes graph-images in a google drive folder, then copies in github repository to enjoy the content via web browser.
It works, more or less! (until january 17th)
